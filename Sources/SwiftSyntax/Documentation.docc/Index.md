# ``SwiftSyntax``

SwiftSyntax is a source accurate tree representation of Swift source code. It allows Swift tools to parse, inspect, generate, and transform Swift source code.

Its API is designed for performance-critical applications. It uses value types almost exclusively and aims to avoid existential conversions where possible.
